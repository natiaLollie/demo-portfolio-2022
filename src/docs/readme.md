## Overview
--------------------


The idea for this '2022 Portfolio Revamp' came about when taking deep interest in a Harvard Computer Science course that immersed students in the history of computer programming. Learning how the past has lead us to what we know as computer and web today was intensely interesting and became a focus on my journey. "No matter how far we may go, a solid foundation should always be the start". My intention with this portfolio revamp is to integrate the structures and assets of the past, with the elements and functionality of the present. 


This portfolio will:


▪ Incorporate those computer and web elements reminiscent to Mac and Windows (1993 - 1996); in combination with the refinement and concepts used in web modern day
▪ Maintain a simple foundation free of tools and libraries 
▪ Reinforce the foundations of programming that I have previously learned; while simultaneously strengthening new concepts.
